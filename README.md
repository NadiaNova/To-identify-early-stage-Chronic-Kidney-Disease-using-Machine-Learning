# To-identify-early-stage-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-using-Machine-Learning

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common, potentially fatal illness that has a significant effect on general health. For successful intervention and therapy, patients with early-stage CKD must be promptly identified. Using a publicly available CKD dataset, this study uses machine learning techniques to categorize people as having early-stage CKD or not.

# Data preprocessing
Data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing features, is where the project starts. We train and assess three different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the precision-recall curve are used to evaluate these models' performance.

# Model
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. and Naive Bayes.

# Result
Project observations show that the Random Forest classifier produces excellent outcomes with a high accuracy rate. The project does, however, point out a number of areas that could use work, including feature engineering, data augmentation, and resolving class imbalance. Suggestions are offered to improve the performance of the classification model.
